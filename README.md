A zero overhead game development framework for beginners.

## Overview
The aim of this package is to remove accidental complexity from the game development process. We therefore always choose simplicity and consistency over features. The users of this package will include young programmers learning their first language, maybe moving up from Scratch. While we aim to support reasonably sophisticated 2D games, our first priority will remain learners, and their teachers.

## Example
The best way to learn how to use this package is by looking at code. There are some simple examples in the [example subdirectory](https://github.com/aviks/GameZero.jl/tree/master/example/BasicGame). More comprehensive examples are listed in the [GZExamples](https://github.com/SquidSinker/GZExamples) repository.

## Status
This is an early release. Please try to make interesting games with this, and report any issues or missing features.

## Acknowledgement
The design of this library is inspired by the python package [PyGameZero](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io) by [Daniel Pope](https://github.com/lordmauve). Much of the design however has been changed to make things more Julian. The implementation is independent.
